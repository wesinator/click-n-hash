# Click'n'Hash

A manifest v3 Chromium extension that allows you to hash selected text using the context menu (right click).

Firefox version is [HashZilla](https://github.com/wesinator/HashZilla/)

#### Known issues (specific to Chrome extension)

 - Chrome alert() message windows that are generated by the extension do not seem to allow copying text. (tested on Linux)
   To workaround, open the console and copy the output of the hash from there

 - Multiline text may be hashed incorrectly because of encoding. 
   This issue has not been observed on Firefox.
